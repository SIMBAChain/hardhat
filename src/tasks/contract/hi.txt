\n\nThere is also a non-interactive login mode. This mode is mainly for CI/CD, but you can run this login mode like a normal login command if you have a few environment variables set, and it will use a client credentials flow for login. You will need to set\n\n1. SIMBA_PLUGIN_ID for your client ID\n2. SIMBA_PLUGIN_SECRET for your client secret, and\n3. SIMBA_PLUGIN_AUTH_ENDPOINT for your auth endpoint.\n\nNOTE: SIMBA_PLUGIN_AUTH_ENDPOINT defaults to '/o/' if not set.\n\nTo run login in non-interactive mode, you can run with org and app flag:\n\n\t$ truffle run simba login --interactive false --org <myOrg> --app <myApp>\n\nOr you can run with just the app flag, if you already have logged into an org before, and just want to switch your app:\n\n\t$ truffle run simba login --interactive false --app <myApp>\n\nIf you already have an org and app set in simba.json, and want to use that org and app, you can just run:\n\n\t$ truffle run simba login --interactive false\n\nHowever, if you specify an org, you must specify an app. The following will throw an error:\n\n\t$ truffle run simba login --interactive false --org <myOrg>\n\n
